This library allows you to control networked projectors that support the PJLink protocol (most of them do - currently tested with Sanyo XU106).
It supports most of the Class 1 Commands described in the spec as well as authentication.

See http://pjlink.jbmia.or.jp/english/data/PJLink%20Specifications100.pdf for full protocol spec (Note: You can read it without downloading 10MB of japanese fonts. ;) )

This library was written in one day (yesterday) and published the day after, so don't be surprised if you find severe bugs, weird comments or unexpected behaviour. All calls are subject to change. It works for us - feel free to adjust it to your needs.
